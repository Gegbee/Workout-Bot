# Discord Workout Bot v1.0.2
This is my repository for a Discord.js bot that can take in workouts and times to create timers for you and friends to workout via Discord.

## How does it work?
The Workout Bot allows somebody to set a delay time before the workout starts, set a rest time for in between each workout, and set the workouts and how long they should be done for. The primary use of this bot is to make a schedule for your workout and initiate timers so multiple people can stay on track for a workout over Discord.

## Why did I make this?
I made this bot because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic made it hard for me to see and workout with my friends, so I decided to use the API for Discord, the software my friends and I use to communicate, and make a bot where we can simultaneously do a workout together.
